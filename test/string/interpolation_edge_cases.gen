# Test string interpolation edge cases

# Empty interpolation should show placeholder
print("Empty: ${}"); # expect: Empty: ${}

# Nested braces should show placeholder for now
print("Nested: ${a{b}}"); # expect: Nested: ${a{b}}

# Multiple interpolations in one string
var a = 10;
var b = 20;
print("${a} + ${b} = ${a + b}"); # expect: 10 + 20 = 30

# String with no interpolation should work as before
print("No interpolation here"); # expect: No interpolation here

# Mixed literal and variable interpolation
print("Result: ${42 + a}"); # expect: Result: 52
