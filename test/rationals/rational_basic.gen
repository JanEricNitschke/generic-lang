# Basic rational number functionality
var r1 = 3:4;
print(r1); # expect: 3:4
print(type(r1)); # expect: <type rational>

# Rational reduction
var r2 = 6:8;  
print(r2); # expect: 3:4

# Integer rational (denominator = 1)
var r3 = 5:1;
print(r3); # expect: 5

# Negative rationals
var r4 = -3:4;
print(r4); # expect: -3:4

var r5 = 3:-4; 
print(r5); # expect: -3:4

# Division by zero error
# var bad = 3:0; # This would cause runtime error

# Arithmetic with rationals (converts to float for now)
# Note: Due to precedence issues, rationals need parentheses in complex expressions

print((3:4) - (1:4)); # expect: 0.5

print((3:4) / (2:3)); # expect: 1.125
