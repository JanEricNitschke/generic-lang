# Note: Due to precedence issues, rational operator (:) has very low precedence
# This means expressions need parentheses for correct evaluation

# These work correctly:
print(true ? 1 : 2); # expect: 1
print({1: 2, 3: 4}); # expect: {3: 4, 1: 2}

# Basic rationals work:
print(3:4); # expect: 3:4

# But precedence with arithmetic requires parentheses:
# print(1 + 2:3); would be parsed as (1 + 2):3 = 3:3 = 1
print(1 + (2:3)); # expect: 1.6666666666666665
print((1 + 2):3); # expect: 1

# Comparison with rationals:
print((3:4) == (6:8)); # expect: true
print((1:2) < (3:4));  # expect: true
