# Note: Tuple implementation is partially complete
# The infrastructure (Tuple class, BuildTuple opcode) is implemented
# but the parsing is not yet working properly

# This will be the expected syntax:
# print(()); # Empty tuple
# print((1,)); # Single element tuple  
# print((1, 2, 3)); # Multi-element tuple
# print(type((1, 2))); # Should show <type Tuple>

# For now, tuples are not functional but the groundwork is laid
