# Test Rational constructor with various inputs

# Basic rationals
print(Rational(1, 2)); # expect: 1:2
print(Rational(3, 4)); # expect: 3:4
print(Rational(-1, 3)); # expect: -1:3
print(Rational(5, -7)); # expect: -5:7

# Reduction should occur
print(Rational(2, 4)); # expect: 1:2
print(Rational(6, 8)); # expect: 3:4
print(Rational(10, 15)); # expect: 2:3

# Whole numbers as rationals
print(Rational(5, 1)); # expect: 5:1
print(Rational(0, 1)); # expect: 0:1
