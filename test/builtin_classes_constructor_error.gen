# Test that calling builtin type classes works appropriately
# These are now working constructors

# Float constructor call should work
print(Float()); # expect: 0.0
print(Float(3.14)); # expect: 3.14

# String constructor call should work  
print(String()); # expect: 
print(String(42)); # expect: 42

# Integer constructor call should work
print(Integer()); # expect: 0
print(Integer("123")); # expect: 123

# Bool constructor call should work
print(Bool()); # expect: false
print(Bool(1)); # expect: true

# These should still error as they don't make sense to construct
print(Nil()); # expect runtime error: Builtin type class 'Nil' cannot be called as a constructor. Use it only for isinstance() checks.
